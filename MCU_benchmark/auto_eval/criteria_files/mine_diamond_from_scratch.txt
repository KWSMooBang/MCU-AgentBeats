**Task Progress: the key factors/steps for completing the task** 
 - whether the agent successfully mines wood (logs)
 - whether the agent crafts a crafting table
 - whether the agent crafts a wooden pickaxe
 - whether the agent mines cobblestone with the wooden pickaxe
 - whether the agent crafts a stone pickaxe
 - whether the agent mines iron ore with the stone pickaxe
 - whether the agent crafts a furnace
 - whether the agent smelts iron ore into iron ingots
 - whether the agent crafts an iron pickaxe
 - whether the agent mines diamond ore with the iron pickaxe
 - whether the agent successfully obtains diamond

**Action Control: whether the agents have unrelated operations of the task, including useless actions and redundancy actions**
 - e.g. wandering aimlessly without purpose
 - e.g. repeatedly switching tools without progressing through the crafting sequence
 - e.g. mining unnecessary blocks that don't contribute to the progression
 - e.g. crafting items not required for the diamond mining progression

**Error Recognition and Correction: whether the agent can promptly identify and rectify its mistakes**
 - e.g. whether agents recognize using the wrong tool for mining (e.g., using wooden pickaxe on iron ore)
 - e.g. whether agents correct their path when going too deep or getting lost in caves
 - e.g. whether agents recognize when they run out of fuel for smelting and gather more
 - whether the corrected results demonstrate improvement and reduce flaws in the progression

**Creative Attempts: any creative attempts exhibited by the agent during doing task**
 - e.g. efficient mining strategies like branch mining or staircase mining
 - e.g. creating temporary shelters or torches for safety while mining
 - e.g. gathering extra resources for backup tools
 - e.g. using lava or water creatively during mining

**Task Completion Efficiency**
 - whether the time taken by the agent to complete the task falls within a reasonable range
 - whether the agent follows the optimal progression path (wood → stone → iron → diamond)
 - whether the agent minimizes unnecessary backtracking or resource gathering
 - whether effective mining strategies were employed to find ores quickly

**Material Selection and Usage: whether the agent correctly utilize the given materials**
 - e.g. using the correct tier of pickaxe for each ore type (wooden for cobblestone, stone for iron, iron for diamond)
 - e.g. efficient use of fuel for the furnace (coal, wood, or planks)
 - e.g. crafting the minimum necessary tools without excessive waste
 - e.g. using gathered materials appropriately for progression rather than hoarding
